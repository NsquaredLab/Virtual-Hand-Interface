# Virtual Hand Interface
Developed by [Dominik I. Braun](https://github.com/Daserym/).

## What is it?
The virtual hand interface can be used in experiments where the user needs to show the subjects a specific hand movement and then asks the subject to follow the movement of the "control" hand. The predicted movement by a classifier/machine learning/... is then seen at the "prediction" hand.
